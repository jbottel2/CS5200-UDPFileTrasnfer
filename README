HOW TO COMPILE
-------------------------
Compile all of the sources:
javac *.java


HOW TO RUN
-------------------------
The code is initially set up to perform a file transfer using UDP Protocol.

SERVER
---------------
Run a server with:
java dl_server port_number

The server will receive files continually until terminated. It will rewrite
the output.dat file each time a new file is received.

CLIENT
--------------
Run a client with:
java dl_client hostname port_number file_name


TCP
-------------
If you wish to perform a file transfer using TCP Protocol,
modify the code in "dl_client" so that instead of an instance
of ClientTransport being created, it should be a TCPClientTransport
instance. The same process should be done for the server. Recompile
and then run.
